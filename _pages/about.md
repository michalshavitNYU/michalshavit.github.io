I am a Courant Instructor and Simons Research Fellow on Wave Turbulence at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.
I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) under the wonderful guidance of [Prof. Gregory Falkovich](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/home).

I am working on Wave Turbulence of (non-isotropic) systems dominated by three-wave interactions.
